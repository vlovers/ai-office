# Delivery production readiness checklist

Status: **unreleased authorization foundation; remote write activation blocked**.

## Implemented

- [x] Actual merged journal/lease/approval/receipt/recovery controls audited.
- [x] Dedicated Delivery ingress; dashboard remains local-only.
- [x] Administrator-mediated server sessions, hashed secret storage, absolute
      expiry, durable revocation, rollback-resistant clock and live grants.
- [x] Exact HTTPS Origin/Host, CSRF, secure host cookie, strict bounded JSON,
      request timeouts, safe response headers/errors.
- [x] Server-reviewed registry; shared-lease Git attestation; exact operation,
      operator/session/workspace/repo/branch/head/base approval binding.
- [x] Live authorization inside atomic approval/transfer intent reservation;
      concurrent replay cannot reserve twice.
- [x] GET-only credential boundary, expiry and durable rejection quarantine;
      no GitHub token in SQLite, HTTP responses or frontend modules.
- [x] Registered recovery under existing Git leases before listening; missing
      or stale unresolved registrations fail startup.
- [x] Real Git/SQLite/HTTP and independent-process runtime restart, contention,
      session persistence and administrator revocation tests.
- [x] No HTTP commit/push/publication/merge/force/reset/delete/retry path.

## Deployment blockers before real operator access

- [ ] Provision and test TLS ingress, exact public Host/Origin, Secure cookies
      and CSRF in a real browser; network policy and secret-free ingress logs.
      Route only Delivery, never the dashboard or Vite.
- [ ] Establish trusted operator verification/enrollment handoff and least
      workspace grants. Add verified SSO/MFA if deployment policy requires it.
- [ ] Provision immutable registry snapshots from real ownership/review records
      and verify them on the target host. Dashboard registry/UI wiring is pending.
- [ ] Provision/rotate real repository-scoped read-only GitHub credentials and
      independently verify actual permissions, expiry and revocation.
- [ ] Configure quotas/rate limits, bounded secret-free audit collection,
      monitoring, private storage and tested backup/restore/rollback procedures.


## SQLite filesystem hardening — operator migration gate (PR #72)

The Delivery data directory must already be owned by the service account and private (no group/other permissions). Existing `delivery.sqlite`, `delivery.sqlite-journal`, `delivery.sqlite-wal` and `delivery.sqlite-shm` files must be regular, owned by that account, private, and have exactly one hard link. Startup now refuses unsafe paths instead of silently changing their permissions. Do not recursively chmod unknown paths or follow links while repairing an installation.

Before upgrading, stop all Delivery processes and confirm there is no active SQLite writer. Back up the directory to a private location and record owner, mode, link count, and canonical path of every file. Use a trusted administrator to inspect any unexpected symlink, hard link, file type or owner **before** correcting anything; do not automatically overwrite or remove suspect files. If the old service created world-readable files, assess possible credential/session exposure and revoke affected sessions as needed. Only restore known-good data with restrictive permissions, then test WAL open/restart and retained sessions with a disposable copy before restarting the service.

The directory must not be writable by untrusted local processes: SQLite uses pathnames for auxiliary files after the preflight, so these checks do not eliminate concurrent path-replacement races. A dedicated service account and a private, trusted parent directory remain deployment requirements. Remote GitHub writes stay disabled.

## Additional blockers before any remote write feature

- [ ] Independently review authenticated UI-to-executor wiring and final live
      authorization/revocation races. This implementation mounts no executor.
- [ ] Retain reviewed ownership/snapshot, independent commit/push receipts,
      credential permissions and separate stage approvals under the same Git
      lease through one external attempt and independent receipt verification.
- [ ] Close/audit publication approval-consumption versus journal-reservation
      crash atomicity before exposing a PR writer; transfer atomicity does not
      imply publication atomicity.
- [ ] Run target-platform native end-to-end write/crash tests with a disposable
      repository and actual least-privilege credentials; prove moved ref,
      timeout/revoke/receipt failures never permit blind replay.
- [ ] Integrate stable startup discovery with the real task registry and retain
      unresolved registrations through upgrades and rollback.
- [ ] Independent security review and all required CI green before activation.
      Keep [issue #58](https://github.com/vlovers/ai-office/issues/58) open until
      its remaining gates are proven. No unattended merge/deploy product feature.
